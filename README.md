# World of Warcraft Shadowlands Resources
Feel free to edit this repo with additional links and categories. I have not launched a site but I'll start working on this soon. The site will get the resources from links.md file. You can add additional links there.
This is how you should format the items you want to add:
Category:
```markdown
## Category Name
```
Link: - in format `[name](link) - description`
```markdown
[World of Warcraft homepage](https://worldofwarcraft.com/) - Blizzard official wow homepage
```
